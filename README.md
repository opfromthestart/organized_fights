# organized_fights
A fabric mod that allows named mobs to fight on a team. \
If you use this mod in content like a video or modpack, please credit me. \
Still a work in progress. If you find any bugs put them in the issues section.

# Usage
Use a nametag on a mob to make it part of a team. Mobs on the same team will not attack each other, and mobs on different teams will attack each other. Mobs on a team will not attack mobs without a team.
Special characters:
"\*" will make the mob attack all other mobs.
"+" will make the mob attack all mobs that are not on their team, including ones without a team.
"\_" will make all other mobs attack that mob, regardless of whether or not they are on a team.
"-" will make the mob only attack mobs on its own team.
